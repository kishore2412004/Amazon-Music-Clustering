# 🎵 Amazon Music Clustering — Streamlit App

## 📘 Overview
**Amazon Music Clustering** is a data-driven music recommendation project that groups songs into **meaningful clusters** based on their **audio features** such as energy, tempo, danceability, and valence.  

The goal is to **analyze music characteristics** and create a system that:
- Groups songs that sound similar.  
- Helps users explore songs like in **Amazon Music / Spotify playlists**.  
- Recommends fresh tracks dynamically from **Spotify API** based on cluster mood and theme.  
- Visualizes musical trends using advanced data insights.  

This project integrates **Machine Learning (Clustering)**, **Spotify API**, and an interactive **Streamlit Web App** for a rich exploration experience.

## 🌟 Key Features
✅ **Automatic Song Clustering:** Groups songs based on their acoustic and rhythmic properties.  
✅ **Spotify-Powered Recommendations:** Fetches real songs & previews dynamically.  
✅ **Interactive Streamlit UI:** Explore clusters like “Party Hits” or “Chill Vibes” with audio previews.  
✅ **Visual Insights:** PCA plots, heatmaps, feature analysis, and radar charts for deep understanding.  
✅ **Ready-to-Run:** Uses your cleaned dataset (`clustered_songs_final.csv`) directly without file upload.

## 🧠 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Started with a cleaned dataset of songs containing features like:
  - `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `speechiness`, `acousticness`, `valence`, `tempo`, etc.  
- Standardized and scaled these values for better clustering performance.  

### 2️⃣ Clustering
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** to group songs based on audio similarity.  
- Each cluster reflects a distinct **mood or genre** pattern (like Spotify’s playlist logic).  

| Cluster | Theme | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | 🔥 Party & Dance Hits | High energy, loud, rhythmic — perfect for parties. |
| 1 | 🌙 Pop & rock | More louder beats and Speechiness. |
| 2 | 💥 Classical | Moderate instrumental and high acoustic. |
| 3 | 🎸 Energitic | Raw, emotional indie and alternative tracks. |
| 4 | 🎹 Instrumental Lounge | Lofi, background, and instrumental beats. |

## 📊 Insights & Visualizations

The app includes a rich **Insights Dashboard**:
- 🌀 **PCA Scatter Plot:** Shows how clusters separate in 2D space.  
- 🔥 **Cluster Feature Heatmap:** Average feature intensity per cluster.  
- 🎧 **Cluster Size Distribution:** Visual breakdown of songs per cluster.  
- 🧠 **Feature Correlation Heatmap:** Finds relationships among features.  
- 🎚️ **Boxplots:** Compare feature distributions across clusters.  
- 🕸️ **Radar Charts:** Visualize each cluster’s personality (e.g., energy vs. acousticness).

## 🧩 How the Spotify Integration Works

Each cluster is assigned a **Spotify search query keyword**, like “party pop hits” or “romantic love songs.”  
When a cluster is selected:
1. The app queries **Spotify’s Track Search API**.  
2. Randomized results (top trending tracks) are fetched dynamically.  
3. Each song’s **cover image, title, artist name, and preview** is displayed.
